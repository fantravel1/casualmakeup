If they look blue or purple, you're cool-toned. If you see a mix of both green and blue, you likely have neutral undertones. You can also test by holding gold and silver jewelry against your skin — if gold is more flattering, you're warm. Another method: if you tan easily and rarely burn, that's another indicator of warm undertones."

Avoid foundations with a pink or rosy base — they'll look ashy or unnatural against warm skin. Always swatch along your jawline in natural daylight for the most accurate match."

Opt for reds with warm, orange, or brick undertones such as tomato red, warm brick red, or orange-red. Avoid blue-based or berry reds, which can clash with warm skin. Coral-reds and terra cotta reds are especially flattering. A good test: if the red looks warm and earthy in the tube rather than cool and berry-like, it's likely your shade."

Cream blush in peach or coral tones looks especially natural and sun-kissed."

            <p>Warm undertones have a <strong>golden, yellow, or peachy base</strong> beneath the skin's surface. The most flattering makeup shades lean into that warmth: <strong>golden and caramel foundations</strong>, <strong>peach and coral blush</strong>, <strong>terracotta and bronze eyeshadow</strong>, and <strong>warm nude, brick-red, and orange-toned lip colors</strong>. Avoid anything with a blue or cool-pink base &mdash; it will look ashy or clash with your natural warmth. When in doubt, think golden hour: if a shade looks like it belongs in sunset light, it belongs on your face.</p>

          <h2>How to confirm you have warm undertones</h2>
          <p>Before building your color wardrobe, it helps to be certain you actually have warm undertones. Undertone is different from skin depth &mdash; you can have warm undertones whether your skin is fair, medium, or deep. Here are three reliable tests you can do right now.</p>

          <div class="guide-steps">
            <div class="guide-step">
              <div class="guide-step__num">1</div>
              <div class="guide-step__body">
                <h3>The vein test</h3>
                <p>Turn your wrist over and look at the veins on the inside of your forearm in natural daylight. If your veins appear <strong>green or olive</strong>, you have warm undertones. Cool undertones show blue or purple veins, while neutral undertones display a mix of both. This is the quickest and most reliable at-home test because veins sit beneath the skin's surface, revealing your underlying tone without being affected by sun exposure or redness.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="guide-step">
              <div class="guide-step__num">2</div>
              <div class="guide-step__body">
                <h3>The jewelry test</h3>
                <p>Hold a piece of gold jewelry and a piece of silver jewelry against your bare skin (wrist or collarbone area works best). If <strong>gold jewelry</strong> makes your skin look brighter and more alive while silver washes you out or looks harsh, you have warm undertones. This test works because gold reflects warm light frequencies that complement your skin's natural yellow-golden pigment, while silver reflects cool blue light that clashes with it.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="guide-step">
              <div class="guide-step__num">3</div>
              <div class="guide-step__body">
                <h3>The white vs. cream clothing test</h3>
                <p>Hold a pure white shirt and an off-white or cream shirt up to your face, one at a time. If <strong>cream and off-white</strong> are more flattering &mdash; making your face look healthy and warm &mdash; while stark white makes you look tired or sallow, that confirms warm undertones. Cool-toned people experience the opposite. Try this in natural light near a window for the most accurate result.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>If all three tests point warm, you can confidently shop for warm-toned products. If results are mixed, you may lean neutral-warm, which means you have a wider range of shades that work for you.</p>

          <h2>Your warm undertone color palette</h2>
          <p>Once you know you're warm-toned, shopping becomes much simpler. Every product category has specific shades that harmonize with golden and yellow-based skin. Here is your complete color map.</p>

          <h3>Foundation shades</h3>
          <p>Warm-undertone foundations are labeled with a <strong>W</strong>, <strong>G (golden)</strong>, or <strong>Y (yellow)</strong> in most brand shade systems. Look for shade names that include words like sand, golden, honey, caramel, warm ivory, warm beige, or golden tan. The foundation should disappear into your jawline without leaving a pink or ashy cast. In natural light, the right shade will look like your skin, only smoother.</p>
          <ul class="guide-list">
            <li><strong>Fair warm</strong> &mdash; Warm ivory, golden fair, light sand</li>
            <li><strong>Light warm</strong> &mdash; Golden beige, warm nude, warm buff</li>
            <li><strong>Medium warm</strong> &mdash; Honey, golden tan, warm sand</li>
            <li><strong>Medium-deep warm</strong> &mdash; Caramel, warm amber, golden brown</li>
            <li><strong>Deep warm</strong> &mdash; Warm chestnut, rich caramel, deep golden</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Blush shades</h3>
          <p>The best blush shades for warm undertones mimic the flush your skin naturally produces &mdash; think of the color your cheeks turn after a walk in the sun. Cool mauves and fuchsias will look out of place; warm peaches and corals will look like they belong there.</p>
          <ul class="guide-list">
            <li><strong>Peach</strong> &mdash; The most universally flattering warm blush; looks natural on every warm skin depth</li>
            <li><strong>Coral</strong> &mdash; Brighter and more energetic than peach; beautiful on medium to deep warm skin</li>
            <li><strong>Warm nude-pink</strong> &mdash; A muted, warm pink with a peachy base; perfect for subtle everyday color</li>
            <li><strong>Soft terracotta</strong> &mdash; An earthy, sun-baked tone; stunning on medium and deep warm skin</li>
            <li><strong>Bronze-rose</strong> &mdash; A warm rose with golden shimmer; gorgeous for evening or golden-hour looks</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Lip shades</h3>
          <p>Warm-toned lips follow the same principle: lean into golden, earthy, and orange-based shades. Even when you want a bold lip, choose reds and berries with a warm base rather than a blue one.</p>
          <ul class="guide-list">
            <li><strong>Warm nude</strong> &mdash; A nude with a peach, caramel, or toffee base rather than a pink one</li>
            <li><strong>Coral</strong> &mdash; Bright and fresh, works for both casual and dressed-up occasions</li>
            <li><strong>Terracotta</strong> &mdash; A muted, earthy shade that looks effortless and sophisticated</li>
            <li><strong>Tomato red</strong> &mdash; A warm-based red with orange undertones, not blue; the quintessential warm red</li>
            <li><strong>Brick red</strong> &mdash; Deeper and more muted than tomato; ideal for fall and evening</li>
            <li><strong>Warm berry</strong> &mdash; A berry shade that leans plum-brown rather than cool fuchsia</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Eyeshadow shades</h3>
          <p>Warm eyes come alive with golden, bronze, copper, and earthy tones. These shades enhance the warmth in brown, hazel, amber, and green eyes especially well, but they work on every warm-toned person regardless of eye color.</p>
          <ul class="guide-list">
            <li><strong>Gold and champagne</strong> &mdash; The perfect everyday wash of color for warm skin</li>
            <li><strong>Bronze and copper</strong> &mdash; Rich and dimensional; beautiful in the crease or across the lid</li>
            <li><strong>Warm brown and caramel</strong> &mdash; Versatile and natural for defining the crease</li>
            <li><strong>Terracotta and burnt orange</strong> &mdash; Trendy and earthy; pairs beautifully with gold on the lid</li>
            <li><strong>Olive and warm green</strong> &mdash; An unexpected pop that harmonizes with warm skin tones</li>
            <li><strong>Warm plum</strong> &mdash; A reddish-purple that adds depth without looking cool or jarring</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Colors to avoid</h2>
          <p>Certain shades work against warm undertones by creating visual discord. They can make warm skin look muddy, ashy, or washed out. Here are the main categories to be cautious with:</p>
          <ul class="guide-list">
            <li><strong>Blue-based pinks</strong> &mdash; Bright fuchsia, baby pink, and bubblegum shades have a cool blue base that clashes with warm skin. They can make you look flushed or unwell rather than rosy. Swap for peach-pinks or coral-pinks instead.</li>
            <li><strong>Cool-toned reds</strong> &mdash; Berry reds, wine reds, and blue-reds fight against your warm undertone. They can make teeth look yellow and skin look sallow. Stick with tomato, brick, and orange-reds.</li>
            <li><strong>Silver-based products</strong> &mdash; Silver highlighters, icy shimmer eyeshadows, and cool metallic finishes look stark and disconnected on warm skin. Choose gold, bronze, or champagne metallics instead.</li>
            <li><strong>Cool grey eyeshadow</strong> &mdash; Charcoal and silver-grey shades lack the warmth your skin needs. If you want a smoky eye, use warm browns, deep bronze, or espresso tones to build depth.</li>
            <li><strong>Ashy or grey-toned nudes</strong> &mdash; Nude lipsticks and eyeshadows with a grey or cool-mauve base will make warm skin look flat. Always check that nudes lean peachy, golden, or toffee.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Product recommendations by category</h2>
          <p>Here are specific product picks for warm undertones across three budget tiers. Every product below comes in warm-friendly shades that complement golden and peachy skin.</p>

                <h3>Foundation &amp; base</h3>
                <p>Look for formulas labeled with warm, golden, or yellow shade indicators. Tinted moisturizers and skin tints are especially forgiving for undertone matching because they sheer out on the skin.</p>

          <p>Here is how a complete warm-undertone makeup look comes together in about 7 minutes:</p>
          <ol class="guide-list guide-list--numbered">
            <li>Apply a golden-toned tinted moisturizer or skin tint with your fingers, blending outward from the center of your face</li>
            <li>Dab concealer on dark circles and any redness &mdash; choose a shade with a peach or golden corrector base</li>
            <li>Sweep a warm bronzer along your cheekbones, temples, and jawline to add natural warmth and dimension</li>
            <li>Tap peach or coral cream blush onto the apples of your cheeks and blend upward toward the temples</li>
            <li>Apply a champagne or gold shimmer across the eyelids and blend a warm brown into the crease</li>
            <li>One coat of brown or brown-black mascara for a softer, more natural look that complements warm tones</li>
            <li>Finish with a warm nude or coral lip &mdash; gloss for casual days, matte for something bolder</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The thread connecting every step is warmth. When every product on your face shares the same golden undertone family, the overall effect is cohesive and effortless &mdash; like your skin is naturally glowing rather than wearing separate products.</p>

              <summary class="faq-item__question">How can I tell if I have warm or neutral undertones?</summary>
              <div class="faq-item__answer">
                <p>The easiest test is to look at the veins on the inside of your wrist in natural light. If they appear green or olive, you have warm undertones. If they look blue or purple, you're cool-toned. If you see a mix of both green and blue, you likely have neutral undertones. You can also test by holding gold and silver jewelry against your skin &mdash; if gold is more flattering, you're warm. Another method: if you tan easily and rarely burn, that's another indicator of warm undertones.</p>

              <summary class="faq-item__question">What is the best foundation shade for warm undertones?</summary>
              <div class="faq-item__answer">
                <p>Look for foundation shades labeled with W (warm), G (golden), or Y (yellow). Warm-undertone foundations have a golden, peachy, or yellow base rather than a pink or blue one. Shades described as "sand," "golden beige," "warm ivory," "caramel," or "honey" tend to work beautifully. Avoid foundations with a pink or rosy base &mdash; they'll look ashy or unnatural against warm skin. Always swatch along your jawline in natural daylight for the most accurate match.</p>

              <summary class="faq-item__question">Can warm undertones wear red lipstick?</summary>
              <div class="faq-item__answer">
                <p>Absolutely &mdash; warm undertones look stunning in red lipstick when you choose the right shade. Opt for reds with warm, orange, or brick undertones such as tomato red, warm brick red, or orange-red. Avoid blue-based or berry reds, which can clash with warm skin. Coral-reds and terra cotta reds are especially flattering. A good test: if the red looks warm and earthy in the tube rather than cool and berry-like, it's likely your shade.</p>

              <summary class="faq-item__question">What are the best blush colors for warm skin?</summary>
              <div class="faq-item__answer">
                <p>The most flattering blush shades for warm undertones include peach, apricot, warm coral, soft terracotta, warm nude-pink, and bronze-rose. These shades mimic the natural flush that warm skin produces in the sun. Avoid cool mauves, blue-based pinks, and fuchsia shades &mdash; they tend to look out of place on warm skin. Cream blush in peach or coral tones looks especially natural and sun-kissed.</p>
