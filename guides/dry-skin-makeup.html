            <p>The best casual makeup approach for dry skin uses a <strong>hydrating primer with hyaluronic acid</strong>, <strong>cream or liquid foundation with moisturizing ingredients</strong>, <strong>cream blush and bronzer</strong>, and a <strong>dewy setting spray</strong>. Skip powder entirely &mdash; it clings to dry patches and amplifies flaking. Apply products with a damp beauty sponge to press them into skin. Finish with a hydrating mist. The full routine takes just 5 minutes.</p>

          <h2>Why dry skin needs a different approach</h2>
          <p>Dry skin lacks sufficient sebum production, which means the natural oils that keep skin supple and help makeup adhere are in short supply. The result? Foundation clings to dry patches, powder settles into fine lines, and everything looks flat and flakey by midday.</p>
          <p>The biggest mistake people with dry skin make is skipping skincare prep and jumping straight to makeup. The second biggest mistake? Using powder products designed for oily skin types, thinking they'll give a polished finish. They won't &mdash; they'll make every dry patch and fine line dramatically more visible.</p>
          <p>The casual makeup approach for dry skin embraces moisture at every step. We use cream-based products that mimic your skin's texture, skip powder altogether, and lock everything in with hydrating mists that add dewiness rather than stripping it away.</p>

            <span class="guide-image__caption">Cream-based products are your best friend when dealing with dry skin.</span>
          </div>

          <h2>The 5-minute hydrating dry skin routine</h2>
          <p>This routine is built around one principle: moisture in, powder out. Every product adds hydration to your skin rather than taking it away. The result is a dewy, healthy glow that lasts comfortably all day.</p>

                <h3>Hydrating primer (whole face)</h3>
                <p>Unlike oily skin types who only prime the T-zone, dry skin benefits from primer everywhere. Choose a hydrating primer with hyaluronic acid or glycerin &mdash; it creates a moisture-rich base that helps foundation glide on and prevents it from clinging to dry patches. Apply a thin layer and let it sink in for 60 seconds before moving on.</p>

                <h3>Cream or dewy foundation</h3>
                <p>Use a hydrating cream foundation, skin tint, or dewy-finish tinted moisturizer. Apply with a damp beauty sponge &mdash; the moisture in the sponge sheers out the product and presses it into the skin rather than dragging it across dry patches. Build coverage in thin layers where needed. Let your skin's natural texture show through on the cheeks for a real, human finish.</p>

                <h3>Creamy concealer (no setting)</h3>
                <p>Apply a hydrating concealer under your eyes and on any spots that need extra coverage. Use a formula with moisturizing ingredients &mdash; avoid anything that dries down completely matte. Blend with your ring finger using gentle tapping motions. Do <em>not</em> set with powder. Let the concealer stay creamy for a natural, skin-like finish.</p>

                <h3>Cream blush + cream bronzer</h3>
                <p>This is where dry skin actually has an advantage. Cream products melt beautifully into skin that isn't producing excess oil, giving you a lit-from-within glow that oily skin types struggle to achieve. Smile and dab cream blush on the apples of your cheeks, blending upward toward the temples. Add a touch of cream bronzer to the hollows of your cheeks, temples, and jawline. One coat of mascara finishes the eyes.</p>

              <div class="guide-step__body">
                <h3>Hydrating setting mist (skip the powder)</h3>
                <p>Instead of setting powder, finish with a hydrating facial mist. Hold it 8&ndash;10 inches from your face and spritz in a wide X pattern. This melts all the layers together, adds a final touch of dewiness, and locks your makeup in place without any of the drying effects of powder. Your skin should look luminous and fresh &mdash; like you just came from a spa, not a makeup counter.</p>

          <h2>Products to avoid with dry skin</h2>
          <ul class="guide-list">
            <li><strong>Matte foundations and primers</strong> &mdash; They cling to every dry patch and fine line, emphasizing texture you want to smooth out</li>
            <li><strong>Heavy setting powder</strong> &mdash; Powder absorbs the moisture your skin desperately needs and settles into creases within hours</li>
            <li><strong>Alcohol-based primers and setting sprays</strong> &mdash; Denatured alcohol strips moisture from skin and worsens dryness throughout the day</li>
            <li><strong>Powder blush and powder bronzer</strong> &mdash; They sit on top of dry skin rather than melting in, creating a patchy, unblended finish</li>
            <li><strong>Long-wear or waterproof formulas (for base makeup)</strong> &mdash; These formulas are designed to resist moisture, which means they'll feel tight and uncomfortable on dry skin</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The midday moisture refresh</h2>
          <p>Dry skin tends to feel tight and look dull by mid-afternoon, especially in air-conditioned or heated environments. Here's how to bring back the glow in under a minute:</p>
          <ol class="guide-list guide-list--numbered">
            <li>Spritz a hydrating facial mist generously over your face (don't blot it &mdash; let it absorb)</li>
            <li>Gently press a drop of facial oil or moisturizer into any areas that feel especially tight</li>
            <li>Tap a tiny bit of cream blush onto cheeks to revive color</li>
            <li>Reapply a hydrating lip product with SPF</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Keep a travel-size facial mist and a mini moisturizer in your bag. These two products are the dry skin equivalent of blotting papers &mdash; your essential midday kit.</p>

          <h2>Ingredients to look for</h2>
          <p>When shopping for dry skin makeup, these ingredients signal that a product will work with your skin, not against it:</p>
          <ul class="guide-list">
            <li><strong>Hyaluronic acid</strong> &mdash; Holds up to 1,000 times its weight in water, drawing moisture into the skin and keeping it plump throughout the day</li>
            <li><strong>Glycerin</strong> &mdash; A humectant that pulls water from the environment into your skin, creating a smooth canvas for makeup application</li>
            <li><strong>Squalane</strong> &mdash; A lightweight oil that mimics your skin's natural sebum, providing deep hydration without clogging pores or feeling greasy</li>
            <li><strong>Ceramides</strong> &mdash; These repair and strengthen your skin barrier, helping your skin retain the moisture it has and preventing further water loss</li>
            <li><strong>Vitamin E (tocopherol)</strong> &mdash; An antioxidant that nourishes dry skin and helps repair damage from environmental stressors like wind and cold weather</li>
          </ul>
