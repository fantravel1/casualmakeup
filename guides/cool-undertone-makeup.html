            <p>If you have cool undertones, your best makeup shades lean <strong>pink, rose, berry, mauve, and blue-red</strong>. Choose foundations with <strong>pink or neutral-cool bases</strong>, blushes in <strong>soft pink or plum</strong>, eyeshadows in <strong>mauve, taupe, and silver</strong>, and lip colors in <strong>berry, dusty rose, or blue-based red</strong>. Avoid orange-toned products and warm yellow-based shades, which can make cool skin look sallow or muddy.</p>

          <h2>How to confirm cool undertones</h2>
          <p>Before building your color palette, make sure you're actually cool-toned. Undertone is different from skin depth &mdash; you can have cool undertones whether your skin is fair, medium, or deep. Here are the three most reliable tests:</p>
          <ul class="guide-list">
            <li><strong>Vein check</strong> &mdash; Look at the veins on the inside of your wrist in natural light. Blue or purple veins indicate cool undertones. Green veins suggest warm, and a mix means neutral.</li>
            <li><strong>Jewelry test</strong> &mdash; Silver jewelry flatters cool undertones more than gold. If silver makes your skin glow while gold looks slightly off, you're likely cool-toned.</li>
            <li><strong>Color draping</strong> &mdash; Hold a pure white shirt and an off-white or cream shirt near your face. If pure white brightens your complexion and cream washes you out, cool undertones are confirmed.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If all three tests point the same direction, you can shop with confidence. If results are mixed, you may be neutral-cool &mdash; which means you have flexibility with both cool and some muted warm shades.</p>

          <h2>Your cool undertone color palette</h2>
          <p>Once you know you're cool-toned, choosing the right shades becomes straightforward. Here's your complete color guide by product category:</p>

          <div class="guide-steps">

                <h3>Rose-toned foundations</h3>
                <p>Look for foundations described as "cool," "pink," or "rose" in the shade name. Avoid anything labeled "warm," "golden," or "olive." The right foundation should disappear into your jawline &mdash; if it looks yellow or orange on your skin, the undertone is wrong.</p>

                <h3>Pink-based blushes</h3>
                <p>Cool undertones come alive with pink, mauve, plum, and cool berry blushes. These shades mimic the natural flush your skin produces. Apply to the apples of your cheeks and blend upward toward the temples for a lifted look.</p>

                <h3>Mauve and taupe eyeshadows</h3>
                <p>Cool undertones are beautifully complemented by mauve, taupe, cool brown, silver, slate, and plum eyeshadows. For a simple everyday look, sweep a soft taupe across the lid and add a deeper mauve to the crease. Skip warm coppers and orangey browns.</p>

                <h3>Berry lip tones</h3>
                <p>Berry, mauve, dusty rose, plum, and blue-based reds are the standout lip colors for cool undertones. For casual everyday wear, a sheer berry balm or mauve tinted lip oil looks effortlessly polished. For evenings, a classic blue-red lipstick is timeless on cool skin.</p>

          <h2>Colors to avoid</h2>
          <p>Wearing the wrong undertone doesn't look terrible &mdash; it just makes your skin look slightly off. Here are the shades that work against cool undertones:</p>
          <ul class="guide-list">
            <li><strong>Orange-toned products</strong> &mdash; Orange blushes, coral lipsticks, and apricot eyeshadows clash with pink undertones and can make skin look muddy or sallow</li>
            <li><strong>Warm yellows and golds</strong> &mdash; Yellow-based foundations, warm gold highlighters, and mustard eyeshadows pull your complexion toward an unnatural warmth</li>
            <li><strong>Warm bronzers</strong> &mdash; Orange or yellow-based bronzers look artificial on cool skin. If you want warmth, choose a cool-toned or neutral bronzer with a taupe or rosy base instead</li>
            <li><strong>Warm nude lips</strong> &mdash; Caramel, honey, and peach-toned nudes can make cool skin look washed out. Choose pink-based nudes or mauve tones instead</li>
            <li><strong>Copper and warm brown eyeshadows</strong> &mdash; These warm-leaning neutrals can make your eyes look tired. Stick to cool browns and taupes</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Product recommendations by budget</h2>
          <p>Building a cool-toned makeup kit doesn't require a large budget. Here are the essentials at three price points:</p>
          <ol class="guide-list guide-list--numbered">
            <li><strong>Budget (under $15 per product)</strong> &mdash; Maybelline Fit Me foundation in a cool shade, e.l.f. Putty Blush in a pink tone, NYX Butter Gloss in a berry shade, and ColourPop eyeshadow singles in taupe and mauve</li>
            <li><strong>Mid-range ($15&ndash;$40 per product)</strong> &mdash; Rare Beauty foundation in a cool shade, Rare Beauty Soft Pinch blush, MAC lipstick in a mauve or berry, and Tarte eyeshadow palette with cool neutrals</li>
            <li><strong>Premium ($40+ per product)</strong> &mdash; Armani Luminous Silk foundation, Clinique Cheek Pop blush, Pat McGrath lipstick, and Charlotte Tilbury eyeshadow quad in cool tones</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Mix and match across price points &mdash; splurge where it matters most to you and save on products you use less frequently.</p>
