            <p>The best casual makeup approach for sensitive skin uses <strong>mineral-based products with zinc oxide</strong>, <strong>fragrance-free formulas</strong>, and <strong>as few products as possible</strong>. Skip chemical sunscreens in favor of physical mineral SPF. Always patch test new products for 24&ndash;48 hours before applying to your full face. Focus on soothing ingredients like centella asiatica, aloe, and oat extract. The full gentle routine takes just 5 minutes.</p>

          <h2>Why sensitive skin needs a different approach</h2>
          <p>Sensitive skin reacts to ingredients that most people tolerate without a second thought. Fragrances, preservatives, dyes, and even certain "natural" botanicals can trigger redness, itching, burning, or full-blown flare-ups that last for days. If your skin stings when you apply products, turns red easily, or has ever broken out in a rash from a new product, you have sensitive skin &mdash; and your makeup routine needs to respect that.</p>
          <p>The casual makeup philosophy for sensitive skin is simple: fewer products, cleaner ingredient lists, and a minimalist approach that protects your skin barrier rather than compromising it. The goal isn't to cover up irritation &mdash; it's to wear makeup comfortably without <em>causing</em> irritation in the first place.</p>

            <span class="guide-image__caption">Fewer, gentler products are the foundation of a sensitive skin routine.</span>
          </div>

          <h2>The gentle 5-minute sensitive skin routine</h2>
          <p>This routine is designed to minimize the number of products touching your face while still giving you a polished, natural look. Every product should be fragrance-free, dermatologist-tested, and mineral-based wherever possible.</p>

                <h3>Mineral sunscreen as your base</h3>
                <p>Start with a mineral SPF 30+ containing zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. This doubles as your primer &mdash; mineral sunscreens create a smooth, slightly mattifying layer that makeup grips onto. Zinc oxide is actually anti-inflammatory, so it calms redness while protecting. Let it absorb for 2&ndash;3 minutes before moving on.</p>

                <h3>Mineral tinted moisturizer or BB cream</h3>
                <p>Choose a fragrance-free, mineral-based tinted moisturizer. Apply with clean fingertips using gentle pressing motions &mdash; avoid rubbing or dragging, which can trigger flushing. Mineral formulas with iron oxides provide natural coverage and actually shield against visible light that can worsen conditions like melasma.</p>

Pat gently with your ring finger (it applies the least pressure) to blend. Avoid concealer with salicylic acid or retinol, which can sting sensitive skin.</p>

                <h3>Mineral blush + sensitive-formula mascara</h3>
                <p>A loose mineral blush with just iron oxides and zinc oxide is one of the safest color products for reactive skin. Tap off excess before applying with a soft, clean brush. For mascara, choose a fragrance-free, ophthalmologist-tested formula &mdash; tubing mascaras are ideal because they remove with just warm water, no harsh makeup remover needed.</p>

                <h3>Optional: Calming setting mist</h3>
                <p>If your skin tolerates a setting spray, look for one with thermal water, aloe, or centella asiatica instead of alcohol. Hold the bottle 10&ndash;12 inches from your face and mist lightly. If you've ever reacted to setting sprays, skip this step entirely &mdash; your mineral products will hold just fine without it.</p>

          <h2>Ingredients to avoid with sensitive skin</h2>
          <p>Read every ingredient list before buying. Even products marketed as "gentle" or "for sensitive skin" can contain known irritants. Here are the biggest offenders to watch for:</p>
          <ul class="guide-list">
            <li><strong>Fragrance / Parfum</strong> &mdash; The number one cause of cosmetic skin reactions. This includes "natural fragrance." If the product smells like anything, check the label carefully</li>
            <li><strong>Denatured alcohol (Alcohol Denat.)</strong> &mdash; Strips your skin barrier, increases transepidermal water loss, and makes skin more reactive over time</li>
            <li><strong>Parabens (methylparaben, propylparaben)</strong> &mdash; Preservatives that can trigger contact dermatitis in sensitive individuals, especially on already-compromised skin</li>
            <li><strong>Essential oils (lavender, tea tree, citrus, peppermint)</strong> &mdash; Despite their "natural" reputation, essential oils are concentrated plant compounds that are among the most common causes of allergic contact dermatitis</li>
            <li><strong>Chemical sunscreens (oxybenzone, avobenzone, octinoxate)</strong> &mdash; These UV filters absorb into skin and can cause stinging, burning, and redness. Stick to mineral filters (zinc oxide, titanium dioxide) instead</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Safe ingredients to look for</h2>
          <p>These ingredients are well-tolerated by most sensitive skin types and can actually help calm irritation while you wear your makeup:</p>
          <ul class="guide-list">
            <li><strong>Centella asiatica (cica)</strong> &mdash; A powerful skin-calming botanical that strengthens the skin barrier and reduces redness. Found in many Korean beauty products and increasingly in Western formulas</li>
            <li><strong>Aloe vera</strong> &mdash; Soothes inflammation on contact, provides lightweight hydration, and helps other products apply more smoothly on irritated skin</li>
            <li><strong>Colloidal oatmeal</strong> &mdash; An FDA-recognized skin protectant that relieves itching and irritation. Ideal in primers and tinted moisturizers for very reactive skin</li>
            <li><strong>Zinc oxide</strong> &mdash; Provides mineral sun protection while actively calming inflammation and redness. It is both a sunscreen and a skin soother, which makes it perfect for sensitive skin</li>
            <li><strong>Allantoin</strong> &mdash; A gentle, non-irritating compound that promotes skin healing and softness. Often found in concealers and BB creams formulated for sensitive skin</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How to patch test every new product</h2>
          <p>Patch testing is non-negotiable for sensitive skin. It takes patience, but it saves you from days of painful, inflamed skin. Follow this process every single time you try something new:</p>
          <ol class="guide-list guide-list--numbered">
            <li>Apply a small amount to the inside of your wrist or behind your ear</li>
            <li>Leave it on for a full 24 hours without washing the area</li>
            <li>Check at 30 minutes, 12 hours, and 24 hours for redness, itching, bumps, or burning</li>
            <li>If no reaction, apply a small patch on your jawline for another 24 hours</li>
            <li>Only if both tests pass, use the product on your full face</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Introduce only one new product at a time. If you start three new products at once and react, you won't know which one caused the problem. Space new product introductions at least one week apart.</p>

          <h2>Tools and application tips for reactive skin</h2>
          <p>How you apply makeup matters as much as what you apply. These techniques minimize physical irritation:</p>
          <ul class="guide-list">
            <li><strong>Use clean fingers</strong> &mdash; Your fingertips are the gentlest applicators. The warmth helps product melt into skin with minimal friction</li>
            <li><strong>Silicone sponges over brushes</strong> &mdash; If you prefer a tool, silicone sponges are non-porous (so they harbor fewer bacteria) and glide without tugging. Traditional brushes can scratch and irritate</li>
            <li><strong>Press, never rub</strong> &mdash; Patting and pressing product into skin causes far less irritation than rubbing or buffing motions</li>
            <li><strong>Clean tools after every use</strong> &mdash; Bacteria buildup on brushes and sponges is a major trigger for sensitive skin reactions. Wash tools with a fragrance-free cleanser</li>
            <li><strong>Remove makeup gently</strong> &mdash; Use a fragrance-free micellar water or oil cleanser. Never use wipes that require rubbing, and avoid waterproof formulas that need harsh removers</li>
          </ul>
