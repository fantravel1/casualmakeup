            <p>Every teen needs just <strong>4 products</strong> to start: a <strong>tinted sunscreen</strong> (protects skin and evens out tone), a <strong>concealer</strong> (for spots and redness), <strong>mascara</strong> (one coat makes the biggest difference), and a <strong>tinted lip balm</strong> (color plus hydration). That&rsquo;s your entire starter kit &mdash; it costs under $20 at the drugstore and takes 3 minutes flat.</p>

          <h2>You don&rsquo;t need a lot to look great</h2>
          <p>Here&rsquo;s a secret nobody tells you when you&rsquo;re starting out: the best makeup doesn&rsquo;t look like makeup at all. Those flawless looks you see on social media? Filters, professional lighting, and hours of work. Real everyday makeup &mdash; the kind that actually works for school, hanging out, and real life &mdash; is simple, fast, and way more affordable than you think.</p>
          <p>This guide is for anyone picking up their first mascara, building a starter kit on a budget, or just wanting to learn the basics without all the overwhelming noise. No experience needed. No expensive hauls. Just easy, practical stuff that actually works.</p>

          <div class="guide-image">

          <h2>The 3-minute school routine</h2>
          <p>This is the routine that gets you out the door looking polished and natural. It works for every skin tone, every skin type, and every school dress code. Four products, three minutes, done.</p>

          <div class="guide-steps">
            <div class="guide-step">
              <div class="guide-step__num">1</div>
              <div class="guide-step__body">
                <h3>Tinted sunscreen or SPF moisturizer</h3>
                <p>This is your base &mdash; and the most important step. A tinted SPF evens out your skin tone while protecting you from sun damage (which matters now, even if you can&rsquo;t see it yet). Apply a nickel-sized amount all over your face with your fingers. It should feel like moisturizer, not paint.</p>
                <div class="guide-step__products">
                  <span class="product-tag">Budget: CeraVe Hydrating Tinted SPF 30 (~$16)</span>

              <div class="guide-step__body">
                <h3>Concealer on spots and redness</h3>
                <p>Don&rsquo;t put concealer everywhere &mdash; just dab a tiny amount directly on any blemishes or red spots. Use your ring finger (it has the lightest touch) and gently tap to blend. Pick a shade that matches your skin, not lighter. One layer is enough.</p>
                <div class="guide-step__products">

              <div class="guide-step__num">3</div>
              <div class="guide-step__body">
                <h3>One coat of mascara</h3>
                <p>Mascara makes the single biggest visible difference for the least effort. Wiggle the wand at the base of your upper lashes and sweep upward. One coat is plenty &mdash; two coats can start to clump. Skip the bottom lashes for now; it keeps things natural and avoids smudging.</p>
                <div class="guide-step__products">

              <div class="guide-step__num">4</div>
              <div class="guide-step__body">
                <h3>Tinted lip balm</h3>
                <p>Finish with a swipe of tinted lip balm. It adds just enough color to tie everything together while keeping your lips moisturized. Pick a shade close to your natural lip color &mdash; you want &ldquo;my lips but better,&rdquo; not a bold statement lip (save that for when you feel ready).</p>
                <div class="guide-step__products">
                  <span class="product-tag">Budget: Burt&rsquo;s Bees Tinted Lip Balm (~$6)</span>

          <h2>The $20 starter kit</h2>
          <p>You don&rsquo;t need to spend a lot of money to start wearing makeup. Here&rsquo;s a complete kit you can buy at any drugstore for around $20 total:</p>
          <ul class="guide-list">
            <li><strong>Essence Lash Princess Mascara</strong> &mdash; ~$5. A cult favorite that rivals high-end mascaras. Seriously.</li>
            <li><strong>e.l.f. Hydrating Camo Concealer</strong> &mdash; ~$7. Great coverage, huge shade range, and it doesn&rsquo;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li><strong>Burt&rsquo;s Bees Tinted Lip Balm</strong> &mdash; ~$6. Natural ingredients, subtle color, and keeps lips soft all day.</li>
            <li><strong>Garnier SkinActive BB Cream SPF 15</strong> &mdash; ~$12 (or grab a sample size). Lightweight, blendable, and has sun protection built in.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Total: around $20&ndash;$30 depending on where you shop. Check for coupons, sales, and BOGO deals &mdash; drugstore brands run them constantly. That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s your whole kit. You can build from here as you learn what you like, but these four products will carry you for months.</p>

          <h2>What NOT to buy first</h2>
          <p>When you&rsquo;re just starting out, it&rsquo;s easy to get tempted by flashy products. Here&rsquo;s what to skip for now &mdash; not because they&rsquo;re bad, but because they&rsquo;re not beginner-friendly and you&rsquo;ll waste money learning on them:</p>
          <ul class="guide-list">
            <li><strong>Big eyeshadow palettes</strong> &mdash; Those 12&ndash;18 shade palettes look gorgeous, but blending eyeshadow is an advanced skill. You&rsquo;ll use maybe 2 shades and feel frustrated with the rest. Start with mascara; add eyeshadow later when you&rsquo;re ready.</li>
            <li><strong>Full-coverage foundation</strong> &mdash; Teen skin doesn&rsquo;t need heavy coverage. Full-coverage foundation looks unnatural on young skin, can clog pores, and takes real skill to blend properly. A tinted SPF or BB cream does the job better.</li>
            <li><strong>Contour and highlight kits</strong> &mdash; Contouring is a technique that takes practice and good lighting to get right. It&rsquo;s meant for photography and events, not everyday school looks. Your natural face shape is great as-is.</li>
            <li><strong>Expensive brand-name products</strong> &mdash; There&rsquo;s no reason to buy $40 mascara when you&rsquo;re learning. Drugstore products have gotten incredibly good. Save the splurge items for when you actually know what you like.</li>
            <li><strong>Setting powders and sprays</strong> &mdash; With a minimal routine, you don&rsquo;t need to set anything. These are for more complex, layered looks that come later.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Skincare first</h2>
          <p>This might be the most important section in this entire guide: <strong>skincare matters more than makeup at your age.</strong> Good skincare now means better skin for decades. And better skin means you need less makeup &mdash; which means less time, less money, and a more natural look.</p>
          <p>Here&rsquo;s the only skincare routine you need:</p>
          <ol class="guide-list guide-list--numbered">
            <li><strong>Gentle cleanser</strong> every morning and night (CeraVe Foaming Cleanser, ~$11, or Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser, ~$10)</li>
            <li><strong>Moisturizer</strong> right after cleansing, even if your skin feels oily (CeraVe Daily Moisturizer, ~$13, or Neutrogena Hydro Boost, ~$14)</li>
            <li><strong>Sunscreen</strong> every morning, rain or shine (your tinted SPF counts for this!)</li>
          </ol>
          <p>That&rsquo;s three products. Three steps. Takes 60 seconds morning and night. If you do nothing else from this guide, do this. Your future self will genuinely thank you.</p>
          <p>A few things to avoid: don&rsquo;t use harsh scrubs or exfoliants every day (once a week is plenty), don&rsquo;t pop pimples (it spreads bacteria and can scar), and don&rsquo;t skip moisturizer even if your skin is oily. Oily skin that&rsquo;s dehydrated actually produces <em>more</em> oil to compensate.</p>

          <h2>How to talk to your parents about makeup</h2>
          <p>If your parents aren&rsquo;t sure about you wearing makeup, that&rsquo;s okay. Here are some approaches that actually work:</p>
          <ul class="guide-list">
            <li><strong>Start with skincare.</strong> Frame it as taking care of your skin (which it is). Sunscreen is a health thing, not a vanity thing. Once they see you being responsible about skincare, makeup feels like a smaller step.</li>
            <li><strong>Show them the &ldquo;less is more&rdquo; approach.</strong> Parents often worry about heavy, dramatic makeup. Show them what tinted lip balm and mascara actually look like &mdash; most won&rsquo;t even notice you&rsquo;re wearing anything.</li>
            <li><strong>Use your own money.</strong> If you can buy your own products (even from your allowance or a part-time job), it shows maturity and makes the conversation easier. A $5 mascara is a pretty small ask.</li>
            <li><strong>Offer a compromise.</strong> Maybe start with just lip balm and mascara for a few months. When they see it&rsquo;s not a big deal, adding concealer later is an easier conversation.</li>
            <li><strong>Explain why it matters to you.</strong> Be honest. &ldquo;I want to feel more confident&rdquo; or &ldquo;Everyone else wears a little and I feel left out&rdquo; are valid feelings. Most parents respond to honesty better than arguments.</li>
            <li><strong>Invite them to help you learn.</strong> Ask a parent or older relative to take you shopping or teach you what they know. Making it something you do together turns it into bonding instead of a battle.</li>
          </ul>
